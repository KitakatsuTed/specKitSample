# Implementation Plan: Simple ToDo App

**Branch**: `001-todo` | **Date**: 2025-09-06 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

A simple ToDo application that allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks with a clean, intuitive interface. Core features include task creation with text descriptions, visual status indicators for completion state, and basic task management operations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (latest stable)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite (build), Vitest (testing), @testing-library/dom (UI testing)  
**Storage**: localStorage (Web API) with JSON serialization  
**Testing**: Vitest with @testing-library/dom for DOM testing  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
**Project Type**: Single Page Application (SPA)  
**Performance Goals**: Responsive UI (<100ms click response), smooth list operations  
**Constraints**: Simple interface, minimal setup required  
**Scale/Scope**: Personal use, single user, <1000 tasks expected

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Simplicity**: ✅ PASS

- Projects: 1 (SPA only, under max 3)
- Using framework directly? ✅ (Vite, Vitest - no wrappers)
- Single data model? ✅ (Task interface, no DTOs)
- Avoiding patterns? ✅ (Direct localStorage, no Repository)

**Architecture**: ✅ PASS

- EVERY feature as library? ✅ (todo-lib planned)
- Libraries listed: todo-lib (core task management)
- CLI per library: ✅ (todo-cli with --help/--version/--format)
- Library docs: ✅ (CLAUDE.md format created)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: ✅ PASS

- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? ✅ (planned in tasks.md)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? ✅ (TDD workflow)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? ✅
- Real dependencies used? ✅ (actual localStorage, DOM)
- Integration tests for: new library, contracts, schemas? ✅
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test ✅ (enforced)

**Observability**: ✅ PASS

- Structured logging included? ✅ (error handling planned)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (SPA only)
- Error context sufficient? ✅ (validation errors, storage errors)

**Versioning**: ✅ PASS

- Version number assigned? ✅ (1.0.0 in contracts)
- BUILD increments on every change? ✅ (planned)
- Breaking changes handled? ✅ (migration strategy in data model)

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: DEFAULT (Option 1) - Single project structure until Technical Context clarifies web/mobile requirements

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
