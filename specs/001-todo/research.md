# Research Findings: Simple ToDo App

**Phase**: 0  
**Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Complete

## Technical Context Decisions

### Language/Version

**Decision**: TypeScript (latest stable - 5.x)  
**Rationale**:

- Type safety for better maintainability
- Modern JavaScript features with strict typing
- Excellent tooling and IDE support
- Compatible with library-first architecture requirements
- Supports strict TDD with type-checked tests

**Alternatives considered**:

- JavaScript (lacks type safety)
- Python (would require backend/frontend split, more complex)
- Rust/WASM (overkill for simple ToDo app)

### Primary Dependencies

**Decision**: Vanilla TypeScript + Vite (build tool) + Vitest (testing)  
**Rationale**:

- Minimal framework overhead aligns with simplicity principle
- Direct DOM manipulation keeps learning curve low
- Vite provides fast development and build tooling
- No wrapper classes needed (constitutional requirement)
- Library-first approach easier without heavy framework

**Alternatives considered**:

- React/Vue (adds framework complexity, violates simplicity)
- Angular (too heavy for simple ToDo app)
- Svelte (minimal but still framework overhead)

### Storage Solution

**Decision**: localStorage Web API  
**Rationale**:

- Single-user requirements perfectly match localStorage scope
- No backend needed (simplicity principle)
- Persistent between browser sessions
- Built-in JSON serialization support
- Zero setup or infrastructure required

**Alternatives considered**:

- Database (requires backend, violates simplicity)
- File system (requires desktop app or server)
- SessionStorage (doesn't persist between sessions)

### Testing Framework

**Decision**: Vitest + @testing-library/dom  
**Rationale**:

- Native TypeScript support without configuration
- Fast test execution with Vite integration
- Modern testing features (mocking, coverage)
- DOM testing utilities for UI validation
- Supports TDD red-green-refactor cycle

**Alternatives considered**:

- Jest (slower TypeScript setup)
- Playwright (overkill for unit/integration tests)
- Cypress (E2E focused, not needed for simple app)

### Target Platform

**Decision**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)  
**Rationale**:

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- No installation required
- localStorage widely supported
- TypeScript/ES2021 features available
- Responsive design works on mobile browsers

**Alternatives considered**:

- Desktop app (Electron - adds complexity)
- Mobile native (requires separate iOS/Android projects)
- Server-side rendering (unnecessary for simple SPA)

### Project Type

**Decision**: Single Page Application (SPA)  
**Rationale**:

- All functionality can fit in one page
- No navigation complexity needed
- Matches single-user, simple interface requirements
- Faster load times with localStorage
- Aligns with Option 1 project structure

**Alternatives considered**:

- Multi-page application (unnecessary complexity)
- Web app with backend (violates simplicity)
- Progressive Web App (PWA features not required)

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Model Approach

**Decision**: Simple TypeScript interfaces with localStorage serialization  
**Rationale**:

- Type safety for task objects
- No ORM complexity
- Direct JSON serialization to localStorage
- Single data model (no DTOs needed per constitution)

### Library Structure

**Decision**: Core todo-lib + CLI interface  
**Rationale**:

- Every feature as library (constitutional requirement)
- CLI for programmatic access and testing
- Standalone, independently testable
- Clear separation of concerns

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Contract → Integration → Unit order  
**Rationale**:

- Constitutional requirement for TDD order
- localStorage contracts first (data persistence)
- UI integration tests for user scenarios
- Unit tests for individual functions

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Approach

**Decision**: Simple array operations with occasional localStorage sync  
**Rationale**:

- <1000 tasks performance target easily met
- JavaScript array methods sufficient
- Minimal DOM updates
- No virtualization needed for expected scale

**Alternatives considered**:

- Virtual scrolling (premature optimization)
- IndexedDB (overkill for simple requirements)
- Web Workers (unnecessary for task scale)

## Development Workflow

### Build Process

**Decision**: Vite with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier  
**Rationale**:

- Fast development server
- Optimized production builds
- Code quality tools integrated
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript support

### Package Management

**Decision**: npm (standard with Node.js)  
**Rationale**:

- Widespread adoption
- Integrated with Vite
- Simple dependency management
- Good security practices

## Risk Mitigation

### Browser Compatibility

- Feature detection for localStorage
- Graceful degradation if localStorage unavailable
- Modern browser baseline reduces compatibility issues

### Data Loss Prevention

- Regular localStorage backup (JSON export)
- Import/export functionality for data portability
- Browser storage quota monitoring

### Scalability Path

- Current design supports growth to database storage
- API extraction possible if multi-user needed
- Component extraction if UI complexity grows

## Conclusion

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items have been resolved with practical, simple solutions that align with the constitutional principles. The chosen stack (TypeScript + Vite + localStorage + Vitest) provides a solid foundation for TDD development while maintaining simplicity and supporting the library-first architecture requirement.
