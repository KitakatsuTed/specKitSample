## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A user wants to organize their daily tasks by creating a list where they can add new tasks, mark tasks as complete when finished, and remove tasks they no longer need. The app should provide a simple, intuitive interface for basic task management.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the app is open, **When** user types a task description and adds it, **Then** the new task appears in the task list with incomplete status
2. **Given** a task exists in the list, **When** user marks it as complete, **Then** the task is visually marked as completed
3. **Given** a completed task exists, **When** user chooses to delete it, **Then** the task is removed from the list
4. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** user views the list, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their current status

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user tries to add an empty task?
- How does system handle very long task descriptions?
- What happens when user tries to complete an already completed task?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add new tasks with a text description
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all tasks in a readable list format
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to delete tasks from the list
- **FR-005**: System MUST visually distinguish between complete and incomplete tasks
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent adding empty or whitespace-only tasks
- **FR-007**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-user support? Single user per device or user accounts?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data persistence - should tasks persist between app sessions?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Task organization - categories, priorities, due dates needed?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Task**: Represents a single todo item with description, completion status, and creation timestamp
- **Task List**: Collection of tasks belonging to a user [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single list or multiple lists?]
